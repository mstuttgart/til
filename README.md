> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. These are things I've picked up by [Learning In
Publicâ„¢](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9) and
pairing with smart people at Hashrocket.
